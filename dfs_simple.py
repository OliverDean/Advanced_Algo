def dfs(node, target, visited):
    """
    Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used to explore nodes in a graph by going as deep as possible along each path before backtracking.

    How DFS works:
    1. **Initialization**: 
       - DFS starts from a given node and attempts to reach the target node.
       - A visited set is used to ensure nodes are not revisited, preventing cycles or infinite loops.

    2. **Recursive Exploration**:
       - From the current node, DFS explores each unvisited neighbor by recursively calling itself.
       - This process continues, diving deeper into the graph, until the target is found or all neighbors are explored.

    3. **Backtracking**:
       - If a node has no unvisited neighbors, DFS backtracks to the previous node and continues exploring other paths.

    4. **Termination**:
       - DFS terminates when the target node is found or all possible nodes have been explored.

    Characteristics:
    - DFS explores nodes as deep as possible before backtracking.
    - It does not guarantee finding the shortest path, but it can find a path if one exists.
    - Time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    - Space complexity is O(V) due to the recursion stack and visited set.

"""
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to explore nodes in a graph, layer by layer, starting from a given source node.
It explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

How BFS works:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - A queue is initialized with the starting node.
   - A set is used to track visited nodes, ensuring each node is only processed once.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - BFS iteratively processes nodes from the queue (starting with the source node).
   - For each node, all of its unvisited neighbors are added to the queue.
   - These neighbors are marked as visited to prevent processing the same node multiple times.

3. **Termination**:
   - BFS continues until the queue is empty, meaning all reachable nodes have been processed.
   - If a target node is specified, the algorithm can terminate early once the target node is reached.

Characteristics:
- BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph since it explores nodes level by level.
- Time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes (vertices) and E is the number of edges.
- Space complexity is O(V) due to the storage needed for the queue and visited set.

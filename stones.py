"""
    Input Parsing: The number of stones N, initial state S, and target state T are read.
Feasibility Check: Before attempting any moves, we check if sorting S and T results in the same sequence of stones. If they don't match, output -1 as its impossible to reach the target.
BFS Approach: Using BFS, the algorithm attempts all possible moves, maintaining a queue of states (current configuration of the stones) and the number of moves taken to reach that state. For each state, it explores moving adjacent pairs of stones to the two empty cells, and the process continues until the target state is reached.
Visited Set: A set is used to track visited states to avoid repeating the same configurations.
Time Complexity: The BFS explores all possible states, and the number of possible states is small due to N â‰¤ 14. Hence, the time complexity is approximately O((N+2)!), but with BFS, the solution is efficient for small N.
